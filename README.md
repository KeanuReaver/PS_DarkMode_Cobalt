# UCSD Dark Mode - Cobalt

A messy attempt at giving PowerSchool a darkmode. Works fairly well, but requires a large amount of upkeep.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- project/ – All files needed for the plugin installation
- archive/ – Historical versions (ZIP format, dated)
- resources/ – (Optional) Dev-only tools or references

## ⚙️ Features

- Dark Mode triggered off of browser preferences

## 🛠️ Development Notes

Built mostly with css media queries but some javascript. Compress contents of project folder and install using PowerSchool's Plugin Management.

## 🧪 Future Features

- Toggleable controls
- More modular inserts rather than direct edits of PowerSchool css
